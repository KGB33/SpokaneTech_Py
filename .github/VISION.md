# About the Spokane Tech Project


## What is?

The Spokane Tech website is a project for the community made by the community. The aim of the project is to deliver a community resource for all things tech in the Inland Northwest while providing an oppertunity for contributers to gain real-world experience in a shared open souce project.


## What are doing this?

Reason 1:
There is a thriving tech community in Spokane, but many members of our community are disconnected. With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusists are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.

Reason 2:
Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in thier career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the oppertunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributers a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. 


## Initial Vision

What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.


Phase One:
Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.


Phase Two:
Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add lebels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.


Phase Three:
Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide visbility into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resouce to make available to local businesses and the communiity for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resoiurce)


Future goals. 
The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so natually the first version of the website is based on python. In the future the project will be re-created in other langauges/frameworks/etc. (such as Golang or Rust) as member interest dictates. This is intended to foster growth, knowledgesharing, and exposure to different tech stacks and methodologies.


## Interested in participating? Great! Read on...

Here are a few things you can do to get started.

- Go to the site and explore. It's live at www.spokanetech.org

- Look through the open issues and find one that interests you (issues tagged "good first issue" could be great candidates)

- Read the docs: In our documentation directory we have design decisions, style guide, contributing guide and more. Feel free to familiarize yourself with these. 

- clone the repo to you machine and run locally, explore the code, break things, fix things, have fun. Step by step instructions are in the CONTRIBUTION doc.

- Have a feature idea or found a bug? Create an issue here: 


## Need more help or direction? 

Reach out in the Discord channel (best option) or post a question here: 

New to python, django, git, webdev? Reach out in the Discord channel and suggest a virtual meet. We'll schedule these on occassion, or as interest dictates. This can be used as q&a sessions, code paring, shared code reviews, or just follow along as a member works on an issue.
